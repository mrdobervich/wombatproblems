To Do:

General style:  make font size smaller.  Compare look to Proj. Euler.
Re-style the "learn" page.
Style "flashed" messages so they stand out.
Style main page with login box in the header?
Change 'flag!' and 'unflag!' to some kind of clickable icon?
re-style the error box for the register page.

Make sortable table of search results.

Allow problem-listing by problem source.
Make links to problem-sources.

If someone solves a problem and isn't logged in, recommend that they log in
to keep track of their results.

When there's no "check your answer" display, put a small message
asking people if they know the answer, or if they can think of a related-question
that has a numerical answer we could use.
